## Change Request Assessment

# Change Request Document for EmailAnalyzer Project

## 1. Executive Summary
The EmailAnalyzer project requires restructuring to establish a proper folder hierarchy and Docker integration. The primary business objectives are to improve maintainability, facilitate deployment, and enhance development efficiency through organized code structure and containerization. This change will enable scalable deployments and streamline development workflows.

## 2. Detailed Functional Requirements (FR)
### FR1: Establish a Standardized Folder Structure
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The project root should contain separate directories for `src`, `tests`, `scripts`, and `docker`.
  - The `src` directory should house the main application code.
  - The `tests` directory should be prepared for unit and integration tests.
  - The `docker` directory should contain Docker-related files.

### FR2: Dockerize the Application
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - A Dockerfile should be created in the `docker` directory to containerize the Python application.
  - A `docker-compose.yml` file should be established to manage multi-container setups as needed.
  - The application should run successfully using Docker commands.

## 3. Non-functional Requirements (NFR)
### Security
- Ensure that Docker containers use non-root users where possible.
- Implement network policies to restrict container communication.

### Performance
- Containerized application should have minimal overhead and efficient resource utilization.
- The Docker image should be optimized for size.

### Privacy
- Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) should be managed using Docker secrets or environment variables.

## 4. Complete Data Model Changes
### Current Database Status
- No existing tables found.

### New Data Model Proposal
- As there are no existing tables, this section is not applicable at this time.

## 5. API Modifications
- No existing endpoints; hence API design is out of scope for this change request.

## 6. Frontend Changes
- No frontend framework or components detected; hence frontend changes are out of scope for this change request.

## 7. Implementation Steps
### Phase 1: Project Restructuring
1. Create the `src`, `tests`, `scripts`, and `docker` directories in the project root.
2. Move existing code files into the `src` directory.

### Phase 2: Dockerization
1. Create a Dockerfile in the `docker` directory:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.9-slim
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY src/ /app
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   CMD ["python", "main.py"]
   ```
2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` in the project root:
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     email_analyzer:
       build:
         context: .
         dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
   ```

## 8. Technical Considerations
### Performance
- Validate Docker image efficiency by building with a smaller base image.

### Security
- Ensure that the Dockerfile adheres to best practices by avoiding the use of root users.

### Scalability
- The use of Docker allows for easy scaling by adding more container instances.

## 9. Observability Requirements
- Basic logging should be implemented within the application for Docker container health checks.
- Future metrics collection can be planned using tools like Prometheus.

## 10. Rollout Plan with Feature Flags
- Implement a feature flag to toggle Docker deployment.
- Deploy changes to a staging environment before production rollout.

## 11. Risk Assessment and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Misconfigured Dockerfile might lead to inefficient container images.
  - **Mitigation:** Perform a peer review of Docker configurations.
- **Risk:** Potential downtime during restructuring.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement changes in a feature branch and validate in a staging environment.

## 12. Actual Code Examples
### Dockerfile Example
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY src/ /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

### Docker Compose Example
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  email_analyzer:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```
