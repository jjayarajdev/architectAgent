## Change Request Assessment

# Change Request Document for EmailAnalyzer Project

## 1. Executive Summary

This change request outlines the implementation of a proper folder structure and Docker containerization for the EmailAnalyzer project, which currently lacks organization and portability. The primary business objectives include:
- Enhancing code maintainability and scalability by establishing a standardized folder structure.
- Enabling easy deployment and environment consistency through Docker containerization.
- Preparing the codebase for future enhancements like database integration and API development.

## 2. Detailed Functional Requirements (FR)

**FR1: Implement a Standard Folder Structure**

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The project must have a standardized folder structure as follows:
    - `/src` for main application code
    - `/tests` for unit and integration tests
    - `/config` for configuration files
    - `/scripts` for utility scripts
    - `/docs` for documentation

**FR2: Dockerize the Application**

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - A Dockerfile must be created at the root of the project.
  - The application should run successfully within a Docker container using `docker-compose`.

## 3. Non-functional Requirements (NFR)

**Security:**
- Ensure Docker images are built using the latest official Python base image to mitigate vulnerabilities.

**Performance:**
- The Docker container must optimize startup time and resource usage.

**Privacy:**
- No sensitive data should be hardcoded in the Dockerfile or configuration files.

## 4. Complete Data Model Changes

Since there are no existing tables, no SQL migrations or ER diagrams are necessary at this stage.

## 5. API Modifications

No existing APIs were detected. Future API developments should follow RESTful principles.

## 6. Frontend Changes

No frontend framework detected. Future frontend implementations should consider React or Vue.js for component-based architecture.

## 7. Implementation Steps

**Phase 1: Folder Structure Implementation**
- Create the folder structure as per acceptance criteria.
- Move existing scripts and code into the appropriate directories.

**Phase 2: Dockerization**
- Write a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for the application.
- Ensure the application starts correctly in a Docker environment.

## 8. Technical Considerations

**Performance:**
- Use multistage builds in Docker to reduce image size.

**Security:**
- Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools like Clair.

**Scalability:**
- Design the Docker setup for easy scaling by utilizing Docker Compose for multi-container applications in the future.

## 9. Observability Requirements

- Implement basic logging to stdout/stderr for Docker containers.
- Define SLAs for container uptime (e.g., 99.9% availability).

## 10. Rollout Plan

- Implement feature flags to enable or disable specific features within the Dockerized application environment.

## 11. Risk Assessment and Mitigations

**Risk:**
- Misconfiguration in Docker leading to deployment failures.

**Mitigation:**
- Conduct thorough testing in a development environment before production deployment.

## 12. Actual Code Examples

### Dockerfile Example

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY src/requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY src/ .

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

### Docker Compose Example

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  email-analyzer:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
```

### Project Structure Example
